BookByCover empowers you to find exactly what you're looking for with an advanced search feature that allows you to search by book title or author. Whether you're looking for a specific book or exploring an author's entire collection, our search function delivers results.

Every search result is automatically saved, allowing you to revisit your searches at any time. This ensures that no book you’re interested in is lost in the shuffle.

When you navigate to the favorites page, you'll find all the books you've saved neatly organized for easy viewing. Here, you can add new favorites or remove any that no longer capture your interest, giving you complete control over your personal collection.

And if you haven’t saved any favorites yet, don’t worry! The favorites page will display a friendly message encouraging you to explore the library and start building your collection.
